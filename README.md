# JavaScript for Beginners – Course Practice

This repository contains my practice work for the **"JavaScript for Beginners"** course.  
The course included **11 homework assignments** covering the basics of JavaScript, and one **final project**.

## 🎓 Final Project: Smart House Simulation

As a final project, I developed a **Smart House simulation** using **JavaScript prototypes**.  
The project demonstrates how to model real-world objects and interactions between them.

### 🏠 Features
The **Smart House** can include different smart devices:
- **TV** – can be turned on/off, change and display channels.  
- **Heating** – maintains and adjusts the temperature.  
- **MusicBox** – can play/stop music and report current state.  
- **Curtains** – can be opened/closed, with state check.  
- **Light** – can be switched on/off and display state.  
- **Air Conditioner** – can set and display temperature.  

All devices inherit from a common **SmartObject** prototype (with `turnOn` / `turnOff` methods).  
The `SmartHouse` object can manage multiple devices and run them together.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was created for **educational purposes** as my **first step into building object-oriented applications in JavaScript**.  
It shows how to use **constructors, prototypes, and inheritance** to simulate a smart environment.
